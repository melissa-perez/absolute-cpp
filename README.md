# Absolute C++

## Currently creating a whole new repo since this one all over the place.
5th Edition
Qt Creator 4.2.1
Based on Qt 5.8.0 (MSVC 2015, 32 bit) MinGW Compiler

This repository contains the solutions implemented during my C++ self-study. 

The book referenced is Absolute C++, Fifth Edition by Walter Savitch.

My code is not optimized and may contain errors.
